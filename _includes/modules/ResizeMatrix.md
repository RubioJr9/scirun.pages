**Detailed Description**

This module lets the user resize their matrix to the desired size. In the GUI, one can choose the size of the matrix (by defining the number of rows and columns). If the number of elements in the original matrix is not equal to the (no. of column)*(no. of rows) then the new matrix would have zeros appended to the new matrix or few of the elements truncated from their previous matrix depending on the size of the new matrix that they set. They also have an option to set the major of the matrix to row major and column major.
